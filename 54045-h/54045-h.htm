  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE TO FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Admirable as are many of the Jewish cookery books
already before the world, they assume the use of
ingredients and processes too expensive for ordinary
use. The want of an orthodox book, dealing with the
preparation of economical dishes, has been keenly felt
by us during the last few years, and it is this that has
led us to think our little handbook may be of service.</p>

<p class='c006'>In compiling it we have had before us three special
objects: 1, To adapt it to our peculiar dietary laws;
2, To make it suitable for young housekeepers; and
3, To fit it for use in the cookery classes now fairly
started in our midst.</p>

<p class='c006'>We cannot claim absolute originality for all our
recipes, and indeed have many authorities to thank for
kind help in our task. We feel convinced, however, that
many recipes, which have been treasured for years in
manuscript, will prove new and attractive to some at
least of our readers. In this hope we have overstepped
one of our limitations by including a few old-fashioned,
high-class recipes, and some special hints on Passover
and Invalid cookery.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have stated in all cases the <em>approximate</em> time
required for the preparation of each dish; but it must be
remembered that, under different conditions, the time
will vary.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>The Appendix is based on our experience in actual
teaching in schools, and will, we hope, be of use in the
formation of new cookery centres.</p>

<p class='c006'>As âthe proof of the pudding is in the eating,â we
only ask that judgment may be suspended till some of
our recipes have been tried.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The really unexpected success of our little book has
induced us to thoroughly revise it, and add to it a large
number of new recipes. We trust that this will increase
its usefulness, and give our readers as much pleasure in
referring to the book as we have had in altering it and
bringing it up to date.</p>

  <h2 id='hints' class='c004'>SPECIAL HINTS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. In making soups or gravies which require colouring
the outer skins of the onion should be left on.
Mushroom skins are also useful for this purpose, and
impart a pleasant flavour.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='thicken'></a>2. When thickening soups, gravies, etc., mix the flour,
cornflour, arrowroot, etc., to a smooth cream with <em>cold</em>
liquid first, then stir continually from the bottom and
against the sides of the saucepan or other vessel to
prevent lumps.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The dripping from roast mutton, when used for
making pastry, sometimes has an unpleasant flavour. If
a few drops of vinegar and of oil be beaten up with it, it
will be found quite as good as beef dripping.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Home-dried herbs are much cheaper than bought
ones. About June buy the herbs, rinse them slightly in
cold water, strip off the leaves, place the various kinds of
herbs on separate pieces of white paper, in the oven or
on top of it. When the leaves are quite crisp, rub them
through a wire sieve, and bottle them up tight.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. When chopping onions, let cold water run on the
wrists for a minute. This will prevent the eyes from
watering.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When the juice of lemons is required, and the
lemons are hard, place them on a baking sheet in the
oven for a few minutes; they will become quite soft. To
keep them from getting mouldy, wrap each one in tissue
paper, and keep separate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span><a id='raspings'></a>7. Stale scraps of bread should be put in a tin in the
oven, and baked a nice brown. When quite crisp, they
should be pounded and bottled. These âraspingsâ will
be found very useful.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Bread should be kept in a glazed earthenware
pan, which should have a cover, and must be cleaned
frequently.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. To disguise the disagreeable odours which often
ascend from the kitchen during the process of cooking,
throw a handful of cedar dust on the top of the grate.
(Thisâcalled âDust of Lebanonââmay be obtained of
most stationers at about 4d. per packet.)</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Milk is the best thing for removing <em>fresh</em> ink
stains, but it must be applied immediately, and the
stained part washed.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. A little powdered sugar sprinkled on a fire, which
is almost out, will invariably revive it. Salt sprinkled on
a fire clears it for grilling, roasting, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. House flannels should be herringboned all round
before they are used. This ensures their lasting longer,
and prevents sinks being stopped up by the ravellings.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. It is a decided economy to order soap in large
quantities. It should be cut up when new, and stored
for several weeks in a warm place to dry. Candles also
last longer if kept some weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. All stores should be kept in air-tight tins or glazed
jars.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='browning'></a>15. Liquid browning, for colouring soups and gravies,
should be made as follows, and kept in a bottle for
use:âPut 2 oz. pounded loaf sugar in a small iron
saucepan; let it melt, stirring with an iron spoon; when
very dark (but not black), add Â½ pint hot water; let it
boil up, and when cool, bottle it. A few drops are
sufficient to colour a quart of liquid.</p>

  <h2 id='koshering' class='c004'>KOSHERING.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Leviticus, ch. xvii. 10, 11:ââAnd whatsoever man
there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that
sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood;
I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For
the life of the flesh is in the blood.â</p>

<p class='c006'>When purchasing meat, care must be taken to see
that all veins of blood, forbidden fat, and the prohibited
sinew have been removed. It is the custom in London
to affix a label marked âPorgedâ on joints from the
hind-quarters, which have been prepared in accordance
with our ordinances.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are the Jewish regulations for koshering
meat and poultry:â</p>

<p class='c006'>The meat is put into a pan, specially reserved for the
purpose, and is then entirely covered with cold water,
and left in it for half-an-hour. Before removing the meat
from the water, every clot of blood must be washed off.
It should then be put upon the salting board (a wooden
board perforated with holes), or a basket lid, placed in a
slanting position, so that the water may run off. Finely
powdered salt is then sprinkled profusely over every part
of the meat. The meat must remain in salt for one
hour. It is then removed, held over a sink or pan, and
well rinsed with cold water three times, so that all the
salt is washed off. Then it is placed in a clean cloth,
and thoroughly dried.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>The heart and the lungs must be cut open before
being soaked, so that the blood may flow out. The liver
must be prepared apart from other meat. It must be cut
open, washed in cold water, fried over the fire on a
shovel, and, whilst frying, it must be salted. When fried
the blood must be well washed from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The head and feet of an animal may be koshered with
the hair or skin adhering thereto. The head should,
however, be cut open, the brain removed and koshered
separately. The ends of the claws and hoofs must be
cut off before the feet are koshered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poultry is koshered in the same way as meat, taking
care that previous to the soaking in water the whole of
the inside be completely removed.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 class='c004'>SOUPS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='soups01' class='c007'>Hints on Making Soups and Stock.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Every housewife should bear in mind that a stock-pot
always on the fire is a great aid to economy. Any odd
pieces, trimmings, cooked bones, the liquor in which
meat or poultry has been boiled (commonly known as
<i>pot-liquor</i>), should be thrown in, and the pot kept about
three parts full of water. When soup or gravy is required
the stock should be well skimmed, and poured into a
clean saucepan. The pot may be of brown earthenware
with a cover and must be cleaned frequently. It should
often be looked over, soft bones removed and fresh ones
added.</p>

<p class='c006'>In preparing soups:â</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Allow plenty of time, so that all the goodness of
the ingredients may be thoroughly extracted. To do this
effectually always put soup-meat into <em>cold</em> water, so that
the outside may not be hardened, and the flow of the
juices may not be checked.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Make the stock the day before the soup is wanted.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Let the stock boil once; remove the scum, and
draw the saucepan to the side of the fire to <em>simmer</em>
only.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When the stock is made pour it at once into a clean
basin and leave it uncovered. Remove the fat from the
top next morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Bread fried in boiling oil or fat, and cut into small
squares, should be served with all thick soups.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>
  <h3 id='soups02' class='c007'>To Make Fresh Stock. Timeâ5 hours.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Order a melt (cost 8d.) from the butcher. After
koshering, skin it, and notch it across several times;
add 2 quarts of cold water, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 onion
stuffed with whole peppers and cloves, salt, and simmer
about 5 hours. This will make about 3 pints of good
stock, and is more economical than any other soup-meat.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>Another way of Making Fresh Stock. Timeâ5 hours.</h3>

<p class='c008'>2 lbs. shin of beef, 1 turnip, 1 carrot, 1 onion, Â½ head
celery, 1 teaspoonful salt, Â½ teaspoonful pepper, 2 quarts
cold water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cut the meat into pieces, break up the bones, add the
cold water and the salt. Bring to the boil and skim well.
Prepare the vegetables, cut them into pieces, and add
them. Simmer 5 hours. This will make about 3 pints
of good stock.</p>

<h3 id='soups03' class='c007'>White Stock.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Same as above, using knuckle of veal and poultry-bones
instead of beef.</p>

<h3 id='soups04' class='c007'>To Clear Soup. Timeâ1 hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>3 pints stock, Â½ lb. gravy beef, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1
onion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chop up the beef fine; clean the vegetables and cut
them into small pieces. After removing all the fat from
the stock, which should now be in the form of jelly, place
it in a stew-pan with the meat and vegetables. Whisk it
over the fire until just on boiling point, when it should
be left to boil up well. It should now be clear. Fix a
clean kitchen-cloth on the legs of a chair, placed with its
seat on a table; pour boiling water several times through
the cloth into a basin, and then let the soup run twice
slowly through the cloth.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Another Way.</i>âUse 2 whites of eggs whisked in
Â½ pint cold water, instead of the gravy beef.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h3 id='soups05' class='c007'>Green Pea Soup. Timeâ1 hour.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>1 pint green peas, 1 quart stock, a few sprigs parsley,
a small bunch of mint, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful
flour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Put the stock on, and when it boils add the salt, peas
and other ingredients. When the vegetables are tender
pass them through a sieve with the stock they were
boiled in; boil it up again in a clean stew-pan; thicken
it carefully with flour, and cook 10 minutes.</p>

<h3 id='soups06' class='c007'>Julienne Soup. Timeâ2 hours.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 large carrot, 1 small turnip, 2 leeks, 1 onion,
Â½ head celery, 2 oz. dripping, 1 cabbage-lettuce, a little
tarragon and chervil, 1 teaspoonful sugar, salt to taste,
3 pints stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shred all the vegetables to the same length and size;
fry all except the lettuce, tarragon and chervil, a light
brown in the dripping in the stew-pan. Clear the stock as
directed on <a href='#soups04'>page 2</a>; boil it and add it with the sugar
and salt to the vegetables; skim well until all grease is
removed, add the lettuce, tarragon, and chervil; let it
boil a few minutes, and serve.</p>

<h3 id='soups07' class='c007'>Kugel.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 pint dried green peas, 1 quart large haricot beans,
both soaked over-night; 2 lbs. clod, 1 large onion stuffed
with cloves, 1 tablespoonful flour; salt and pepper to
taste.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><i>Pudding.</i></h4>

<p class='c008'>2 eggs, Â¼ lb. suet, Â½ lb. flour, Â¼ lb. brown sugar, Â¼ lb.
currants, Â¼ lb. raisins or sultanas, 2 oz. candied peel: spice
to taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shred the suet and candied peel, wash and dry the
currants, stone the raisins, mix all the dry ingredients together,
add the eggs, well-beaten, place in a greased basin
and tie a cloth over. Put the basin at the bottom of a
large earthenware pan; place a plate on the top of the
basin and the meat on this. Throw the peas, beans,
onion, pepper, salt and flour into the pan, cover all with
water, and tie a piece of brown paper over the pan.
Put it in the oven when the cooking is finished on
Friday, and dish up when required on Saturday, serving
the soup, meat, and pudding as separate courses.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h3 id='soups08' class='c007'>Liver Soup. Timeâ2 hours.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>1 quart pot-liquor, 6 oz. liver, 1 egg, 3 oz. dripping,
2 tablespoonfuls flour, half small roll; pepper and salt to
taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brown the flour in the dripping; add the liver cut in
small pieces, the egg and bread, and let all brown in the
pan until thoroughly done a good dark colour. Pound it,
and return to the saucepan with the pepper, salt, and
pot-liquor, to simmer about 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id='soups09' class='c007'>Mock Turtle Soup. Timeâ1Â½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 bullockâs foot, 2 lbs. shin of beef, 2 carrots, 2 turnips,
1 small head celery, 1 leek, 1 onion, 6 oz. dripping,
Â½ lb. flour; bay-leaves, cloves, cayenne, and ground
mace; 1 wineglassful sherry.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day before the soup is required cut up the foot and
put it in a saucepan with 2 quarts of cold water; simmer
5 hours, then strain; cut all the flesh off the bones and
chop it up into neat pieces. Put on the shin separately
in 2 quarts of cold water, and simmer 4 or 5 hours. Prepare
the vegetables, cut them up, fry them in the fat in a
large stew-pan; when soft add the flour, and stir till
rather brown. Add the stock from the foot, then that
from the shin, the bay-leaves and all the other ingredients.
When it boils pass it all through a sieve, add the pieces
of bullockâs foot, and simmer Â½ hour. A little soy may
be added if required. Before serving pour the wine into
the bottom of the tureen.</p>

<h3 id='soups10' class='c007'>Mulligatawny Soup. Timeâ2 hours.</h3>

<p class='c008'>2 oz. dripping, 2 onions, 2 apples, 2 or 3 carrots, 1 turnip,
a few sticks celery, a bunch of herbs, 2 quarts stock
or pot-liquor, 2 tablespoonfuls flour, 1 tablespoonful curry
powder, 1 dessertspoonful curry paste, 1 gill water, 1 teaspoonful
salt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prepare the vegetables, fry the onions in hot dripping
in the stew-pan; when brown add the apples cut up and
cored, carrots, turnip, celery, herbs and salt. Boil these
in the stock. Mix the flour, curry paste and powder into a
smooth paste with the water, pour into the soup, and stir
till it boils. The fat should be skimmed off as it rises.
Boil at least 1 hour, and then strain through a sieve.
Serve with well-boiled rice (see <a href='#vegetables21'>page 35</a>).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>

1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 leek, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley,
1 teaspoonful salt, 1 quart water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cut the meat into small pieces (removing the fat), and
put it into a saucepan with the bones, cold water and salt;
bring to the boil. Draw to the side of the fire as soon as

a few sticks celery, a little mace, cinnamon, and 2 cloves,
2 quarts water or pot-liquor, salt, 2 or 3 mushrooms,
1 gill sherry or chablis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prepare the vegetables, cut them up, wash and wipe the
ox-tail, cut it in pieces and fry all in hot dripping in a
large stew pan. Add the herbs, spice, seasoning and
water. When boiling skim off the fat and then stew
gently for 3 hours; strain it into a basin, putting the
pieces of ox-tail into the tureen with the sherry or chablis.
Pour the soup into a stew-pan, stir till it boils. Add the
mushrooms, and cook from 10 to 15 minutes, skimming

  <h2 class='c004'>FISH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><a id='fish01'></a>Fresh fish may be known by its stiffness, firmness,
bright eyes, and bright red gills.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cheaper kinds of fish, such as herrings, mackerel,
haddocks, and plaice, contain more nourishment than
most of the more expensive kinds. All fish must be
thoroughly cleansed in salt and water, two waters at
least being allowed. It must then be very carefully
dried in a coarse cloth kept specially for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id='fish02' class='c007'>To Bake Fish.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Clean and dry the fish very thoroughly, put it on a
baking tin, greased with a little oil or butter, sprinkling
pepper and salt over it. Cover with a well-greased sheet
of paper, bake from 10 minutes to Â½ an hour, according
to the size of the fish. Remove the paper, and serve the
fish with chopped parsley and the strained liquor from
the tin.</p>

<h3 id='fish03' class='c007'>To Boil Fish.</h3>

<p class='c008'>When the fish is thoroughly cleaned, put it on a
strainer or dish, place it in a saucepan with boiling water
sufficient to cover it, some salt and a tablespoonful of
vinegar. Simmer gently till the skin begins to crack.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some of the liquor in which the fish was boiled can be
used for making a sauce.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 id='fish04' class='c007'>To Broil Fish.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Clean and dry the fish thoroughly, split it open, flour
it, sprinkle with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt.
Grease a gridiron with oil or butter, and broil the fish
over or in front of a very clear fire from 10 to 15 minutes.
Sprinkle with small pieces of butter before serving.
Before broiling mackerel or herrings lay them in a
mixture of salad oil and tarragon vinegar for an hour.</p>

<h3 id='fish05' class='c007'>Hints on Frying.</h3>

<p class='c008'>This method of cooking fish requires the utmost care.
It is most important that the fish should be very carefully
dried, and that the oil should be at the right temperature.
To test this throw in a small piece of bread,
and if it brown in less than a minute the oil has reached
the correct heat. When the oil is perfectly still, and a
blue smoke rises, the temperature may also be considered
right. The fish must be well covered in oil, and the
pieces must not come in contact with one another.</p>

<h3 id='fish06' class='c007'>To Fry Fish.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Clean the fish, then cut it as required, and dry it very
thoroughly. Beat up an egg, mix some flour, pepper and
salt on a plate, dip the fish first into this seasoning, then
into the egg, and when the oil has reached the right
temperature, fry the fish a golden brown. Place it on soft
paper on a basket lid to drain. When the oil has cooled,
strain it, pour it into a jar, cover it and it will be ready for
use another time. It can be used again for <em>fish</em> only.</p>

<p class='c006'>To economise the eggs mix a little water with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>To utilise any scraps of fried fish, heat them in melted
butter (<a href='#sauces13'>page 40</a>), flavoured to taste.</p>

<h3 id='fish07' class='c007'>To Steam Fish.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Fish should rather be steamed than boiled, for though
more time is required the result is more satisfactory. If
a fish-kettle is not to hand, place a pie-dish upside down
in a large saucepan, and put the fish on it. Let boiling
water always reach half way up the dish, so that the fish
cooks in the steam. Add more boiling water when required.</p>

<p class='c006'>Clean the fish and dry it, then cut it into nice sized
pieces. Boil as directed (<a href='#fish03'>page 10</a>), then cover and keep
hot. Put the flour into a basin, and add pepper, salt,
and butter (melted); mix well, and make into a paste
with the vinegar. Stir this into Â½ pint of the liquor in
which the fish has been boiled, and cook 3 minutes, stirring
continually. While this sauce cools beat up an egg;
then stir it carefully into the sauce, add the chopped
parsley, and pour it over the fish. If preferred the egg
may be boiled hard and chopped.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>VEGETABLES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='vegetables01' class='c007'>Hints on Preparing Vegetables.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1. Vegetables keep best on a stone floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. All green vegetables should be laid in cold salt
and water for 1 hour before they are cooked. This
draws out all the insects they contain. Carrots should
be scraped, then cut up and thrown into cold water till
they are cooked. Turnips must be peeled thickly, then
cut up and thrown into cold water till they are cooked.
Onions must be peeled, then, as a rule, sliced or chopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Green vegetables should be thrown into boiling
water with a little salt and small piece of soda, boiled
quickly for a few minutes and then simmered until
tender.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. A crust of bread should be boiled with cabbages,
greens, etc. This takes off the disagreeable smell.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Vegetables must never be left over-night in saucepans,
for a poison would be produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. All the waste part of vegetables should be dried
under the grate, then burnt at once, <em>never thrown into
the dust-bin</em>. By this means all unwholesome smells are
avoided.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables02' class='c007'>Baked Beetroot. Timeâ3 hours.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Boil a large beetroot about 2 hours, be careful not to
pierce it. When cold mash it very smooth, add a little
dripping, pepper, salt and stock. Place in a greased basin
and bake for 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables03' class='c007'>Broad Beans. TimeâÂ¾ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Shell, wash and drain them. Throw into cold water
with a little salt and a bunch of parsley. Boil until soft
(20 to 30 minutes), then drain them. Serve either with
melted butter or gravy.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables04' class='c007'>French Beans. TimeâÂ¾ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>String the beans, cut each slantwise into 2 or 3 pieces,
wash them well in cold salt and water, drain them, and
throw them into boiling water with a little salt and a
small piece of soda in it. Let them boil very fast with
the lid off, until tender. Drain the water off and serve.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><a id='vegetables05'></a><i>French beans, Ã  la maÃ®tre dâhÃ´tel</i> are boiled as above,

<p class='c008'>1 pint haricot beans, 1 tablespoonful vinegar, 1 teaspoonful
brown sugar; pepper and salt to taste.</p>

or 6 hours in plenty of water. One hour before serving,
mix the vinegar, sugar, pepper and salt well together,
pour away some of the water from the beans, and add the
mixture to them.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables07' class='c007'>Cabbages, Cauliflowers, Greens, and Savoys. Timeâ1Â½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Cut off the faded outside leaves and hard part of the
stalk, and wash the vegetables well. Cook in plenty of
boiling water, with a tablespoonful of salt to every half-gallon.
If the water is very hard, add sufficient carbonate
of soda to cover a threepenny piece. Boil with the lid
off till the stalk is soft.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables09' class='c007'>Stewed Carrots. TimeâÂ½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Scrape carrots carefully and cut in thick pieces. Place
them in sufficient water to cover them and stew till tender.
Then evaporate water till only half remains. Add a little
dripping, flour and pepper and toss carrots gently in pan
till they are coated with their own juice, and serve.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables10' class='c007'>Stewed Celery. TimeâÂ¾ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Boil some heads of celery, cut into pieces about 2
inches long, in some good stock, add salt, pepper, and a
little lemon-juice. Thicken the stock with flour and
serve.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables11' class='c007'>Colcannon. TimeâÂ¼ hour</h3>

chopped, mixed together, seasoned with pepper and salt,

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h3 id='vegetables13' class='c007'>Boiled Green Peas. Timeâ20 to 30 minutes.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Shell and pick them over, wash them in cold water, drain
them. Throw them into boiling water, add a teaspoonful
brown sugar, a little mint and salt. Boil until quite tender,
drain off the water, and serve in a hot dish with the
mint.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables14' class='c007'>Dried Green Peas. Timeâ4 hours.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Soak over-night; next morning put them in a jar in the
oven with plenty of water, salt and a spoonful of sugar.
Stew gently for 3 or 4 hours, until quite tender. A pinch of
carbonate of soda may be added to the water, to improve
the colour of the peas. Serve either with gravy, or a little
butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables15' class='c007'>Jerusalem Artichokes. TimeâÂ½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Peel and wash them, place in cold water with a little
salt and lemon-juice, and cook till soft. They can be
served either with gravy or butter sauce.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables16' class='c007'>Baked Potatoes. Timeâ1Â½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Choose potatoes of equal size. Brush them very clean,
drop them into a basin of cold salt and water, then dry
them. Place them on a baking sheet, and bake in a
moderate oven. When a fork will pierce them easily
they are baked. The skins should never be eaten.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='vegetables17'></a><i>Another way.</i>âBrush the potatoes, peel them very thin,
parboil them, then brown them under the meat.</p>

<h3 id='vegetables18' class='c007'>Boiled Potatoes. TimeâÂ¾ hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Potatoes should be well brushed, dropped into a basin
of cold salt and water, and when a saucepan of water boils
they should be placed in it. When a fork will pierce them
easily, they are done. The water must then be strained
off, the saucepan drawn to the side of the fire, a clean
cloth folded over the top of the saucepan, and the lid
pressed down on to it. This dries the potatoes, and
makes them a good colour. They should be held in a
cloth and peeled, then re-heated for a minute. <i>New
potatoes</i>, if well brushed or scraped, do not require
peeling.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h3 id='vegetables19' class='c007'>Fried Potatoes. TimeâÂ½ hour.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Well wash the rice in cold water, then put it into the
boiling water with the salt, and let it boil fast 15 to 20
minutes. When it is quite tender, strain it into a colander,
turn the cold water tap on to it for 2 or 3 seconds. Then
place it in a dry saucepan by the side of the fire, with the
lid half on, to dry and get hot. Shake it occasionally to
prevent it burning, and serve.</p>

oil and tepid water gradually, then the white of egg, well
beaten. Peel the marrow, put it into boiling water, and

  <h2 class='c004'>PIES, PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='sweetdishes01' class='c007'>Hints on Making Pastry.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1. Have everything particularly clean and dry.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Pass the flour through a wire sieve, and rub in the
butter or fat with the <em>tips</em> of the fingers only.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Keep everything cool. Always mix the paste with
<em>cold</em> water. To prevent hot hands wash them in <em>hot</em>
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Roll out a short crust <em>once</em> only. If baking-powder
be used, make and bake the pastry as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Test the oven by placing a small piece of bread on
the shelf. If it brown in half a minute the heat is
correct.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Bake in the hottest part of the oven for the first five
minutes, then remove to a cooler part.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Warm jam separately, and place it in the tart at the
last minute. To keep the shape of the tart, place a piece
of bread in the centre whilst baking.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes02' class='c007'>Pastry.âShort Crusts.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 lb. flour to Â¾ lb. butter or fat, <em>or</em> 1 lb. flour to Â½ lb.
butter or fat, and the yolk of one egg; <em>or</em> 1 lb. flour to Â½ lb.
butter or fat, and 1 teaspoonful baking-powder; <em>or</em> 1 lb.
flour to Â¼ lb. butter or fat, and 1 teaspoonful baking-powder.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes03' class='c007'>Flaky Pastry.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Â½ lb. flour, Â¼ lb. butter or fat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Divide the fat into three equal portions, rub one part
into the flour in the usual way, add a pinch of salt and
mix to a stiff paste with cold water. Roll out into a long
narrow strip, rolling backwards and forwards <em>only</em>.
Spread the second portion of fat evenly over the paste,
fold into three and turn with the rough edges towards you.
Roll out again and proceed in the same way. Fold over
and roll to required shape.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes04' class='c007'>Rough Puff Paste.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 lb. flour to Â¾ lb. butter or fat, <em>or</em> 1 lb. flour to Â½ lb.
butter or fat.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Break the butter or fat into the flour in lumps, and
mix to a paste with a little cold water. Roll out, fold
in three, turn the rough edges towards you, and roll out
again. Do this four or six times till the paste is no longer
streaky.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes05' class='c007'>To Bake Puddings.</h3>

<p class='c008'>All puddings containing starch, such as rice, sago,
macaroni, etc., must be baked slowly in a moderate
oven, so that the starch globules may have time to swell,
burst, and absorb the milk. Custards must also bake
very slowly. Puddings containing flour must bake longer
than those made with bread, etc.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes06' class='c007'>To Boil Puddings.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1. Always place these puddings in boiling water; keep
them well covered, and on the boil, adding more boiling
water as required.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. All puddings containing flour must boil longer than
those made with bread, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Puddings boiled in basins must boil longer than
those put only in cloths.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The basin must always be quite full, and must be
tied up in a cloth which has been dredged with flour.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes07' class='c007'>To Steam Puddings.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1. Puddings cooked in this way are lighter than those
that are boiled, but take longer to cook.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The water in the saucepan must only reach half-way
up the basin, and must <em>simmer</em> all the time. More
boiling water must be added when required.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The basin need not be quite full.</p>

<h3 id='sweetdishes08' class='c007'>Almond Pudding. Timeâ1 hour.</h3>

<p class='c008'>8 eggs, 8 oz. castor sugar, 8 oz. ground almonds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beat the yolks and whites separatelyâthe whites to a
stiff frothâthen whisk them together, and stir in gradually
the sugar, and ground almonds. Beat well for 20
minutes, then pour the mixture into well-greased shallow
dishes, and bake in a moderate oven. If a knife when
inserted come out clean, the puddings are done.</p>

little pepper and salt, dredge lightly with flour, and leave
a little while. Then put a piece of greased paper over
the breast, and put down to roast. Remove the paper
Â¼ hour before the fowl is done.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>For the stuffing</i>: Chop the suet and parsley fine, add
to them the bread-crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, nutmeg,
lemon-rind, and lastly the egg, well beaten. Mix all
well together.</p>

<h3 id='invalid11' class='c007'>Cornflour Blanc-mange. Timeâ20 minutes.</h3>

<p class='c008'>2 tablespoonfuls cornflour, 1 pint milk, 1 tablespoonful
loaf sugar, stick cinnamon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Put the sugar, cinnamon, and nearly all the milk, in a
saucepan to boil. Meanwhile mix the cornflour in a
basin to a smooth paste, with the remainder of the milk.
When the milk boils, add to it the cornflour, return all to
the saucepan, and boil quickly 3 minutes, stirring all the
time. Dip a mould in cold water, pour in the cornflour
after the cinnamon has been taken out. When cold turn
out, and serve with jam.</p>

  <h3 id='invalid12' class='c007'>Gruel. TimeâÂ¾ hour.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>2 dessertspoonfuls oatmeal (fine or Scotch), 2 tablespoonfuls
milk, Â½ saltspoonful salt, 3 gills boiling water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mix the oatmeal and salt to a smooth paste with the
milk. When the water boils add it gradually, stirring all
the time. Let it stand Â½ minute, then pour it into the
saucepan, letting the grits remain in the basin. Stir
the gruel till it boils, then simmer 10 minutes more if
fine, Â½ hour more if Scotch oatmeal. Sweeten to taste.</p>

<h3 id='invalid13' class='c007'>Lait de Poule. Timeâ10 minutes.</h3>

<p class='c008'>1 gill boiling water, Â¾ wineglassful sherry, 1 egg,
(nutmeg if liked), sugar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beat up the egg, pour the nearly boiling water over it,
add the sherry and nutmeg, and sweeten. This drink is
very good for a cold, when no milk is handy.</p>

<h3 id='invalid14' class='c007'>Lemonade.</h3>

<p class='c008'>2 lemons, 1 quart water; loaf sugar to taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shave off the yellow rind of the lemon, place the sugar
in a jug, put the rind in a strainer, and pour 1 pint of
boiling water over it on to the sugar. Squeeze the lemons
through a strainer, add to them 1 pint of cold water, then
mix all together.</p>

<h3 id='invalid15' class='c007'>Mutton Broth.</h3>

<p class='c008'>This broth is made just like that on <a href='#soups11'>page 5</a>, but no
rice or barley should be thrown in. The broth should be
strained through a sieve, and served with sippets of toast.
Special care should be taken to have it entirely free from
fat.</p>

<h3 id='invalid16' class='c007'>Toast Water.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Toast a <em>crust</em> of bread carefully all over, but do not
burn it black. Fill a jug with boiling water, <em>then</em> put in
the toast. A bright liquid the colour of sherry will be
the result.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='appendix01' class='c007'>FORMATION OF COOKERY CLASSES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>In these few pages it is our object to give, as clearly and
concisely as possible, directions for the formation and
conduct of the Jewish Cookery Classes which are now
increasing among us. Several yearsâ experience at the
Bayswater Jewish Schools and at the Portuguese Jewsâ
Schools has enabled us to ascertain accurately the cost of
starting and maintaining such a class, and we have
endeavoured to give a clear statement of the necessary
expenditure, together with a list of the requisite utensils.</p>

<p class='c006'>âIn schools in which the Inspector reports that special
and appropriate provision is made for the practical teaching
of cookery, a grant of four shillings is made on account
of any girl (over twelve years of age before the conclusion
of the course) who has attended not less than forty hours
during the school year at the cookery class, and is presented
for examination in the elementary subjects in any
Standard.â<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>â(New Code of Regulations, 1882.)</p>

<p class='c006'>A class-room can easily be adapted as the kitchen by
the introduction of a good-sized cupboard and a simple
open range. A kitchen table should be procured with
screw legs, so that it can conveniently be taken to pieces,
and removed after the lesson.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two or three demonstration lessons, at which a large
number of girls may attend, given at the commencement
of the course, will enable the girls to set about the practice
lessons with some degree of facility. No demonstration
should last longer than an hour and a half, so that
the teacher may secure the entire attention of the pupils.
These lessons will afford an opportunity for dwelling on
the value of foods, both from an economical and medical
point of view.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The practice lessons should last two hours, so that
there may be plenty of time for the pupils to thoroughly
cleanse and put away every article used, scrub the floor
and table and tidy the hearth. In these two hours the
luncheon hour might easily be included.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of girls at a practice lesson should never
exceed twelve, and they should work two together at one
board. They should be shown how to weigh carefully
each ingredient, and should themselves regulate, by a
clock, the cooking of their own dishes. Perfect order
must be maintained, and it is very necessary that neatness
should be insisted on throughout every stage, and that
special attention should be paid to personal cleanliness.
The girls should be made to read through the recipe to
be prepared, and to collect all the ingredients required
before they actually commence to cook.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is desirable that the various processes should be
carried on with the simplest means, so that every girl
may be fairly expected to find in her own home all such
utensils as are employed during the lesson. It is, therefore,
better to avoid the expense of a mincing-machine,
knife-machine, and other labour-saving appliances.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
